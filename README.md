# pythonmeditationmusic
The purpose was to use python and numpy to create a sound file that allowed me to find different sound samples of music, along with using sound frequencies to generate a meditative 22 minute sound file. 
The code supplied along with the wave files will generate a 22 minute file that you can use. 

The goal of this project is to generate meditation files to then publish and share freely. Allowing the community to select the best files generated for personal use.
